Data for Extinction
===================

This repository stores the data used for a number of different
projects to measure and study interstellar dust extinction curves.
The data is organized around ASCII `DAT` and FITS spectra files.
These files are used by the `measure_extinction` code to provide
creation of extinction curves using the standard pair method
with observed and model comparison stars.
